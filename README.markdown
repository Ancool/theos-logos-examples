This is a collection of examples for various uses of Theos/Logos.

If you check out all these examples, make sure to <tt>git submodule init</tt> and <tt>git submodule update</tt> in the checkout directory, or just symlink your local copy of Theos to theos/.

You can also run <tt>make</tt> in this directory if you really <i>really</i> want to build every example.
